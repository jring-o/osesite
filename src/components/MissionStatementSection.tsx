          Open Source is the world's largest public good institution. Like global universities, it fosters widespread education and skill development, builds professional connections and community, and drives significant economic activityâ€”all underpinned by a unique culture, collaborative spirit, and a vast network of over 100 million 'alumni' on GitHub alone.
          <br/><br/>
          The Open Source Endowment is an efficient, lasting solution designed to ensure this vital institution and its global community can meet the fundamental challenge of sustainable funding, securing its continued contributions for generations to come.
